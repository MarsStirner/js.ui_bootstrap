js.ui_bootstrap
===============

Introduction
------------

This library packages `Angular UI Bootstrap`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`Angular UI Bootstrap`: http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.ui_bootstrap``) are published to some URL.
